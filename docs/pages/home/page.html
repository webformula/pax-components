  <p>
    PAX components provide material design to the desktop and mobile with no dependencies. These components can be
    used with any website (framework or no framework) as long as the browser supports web components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mobile web applications are a top priority. Our goal is to make the mobile web experience feel like the best
    native applications. To achieve this we added mobile specific components to support mobile interactions. The
    components automatically change based on the device that loads them. This means no extra work is required to make
    your application mobile ready.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-bottom: 12px">Powerful, and light weight</h4>
  <p>
    PAX components are built to be simple, light weight and performant. This is achieved with web components, which
    are a native browser feature. We are taking advantage of the lowest possible level in the browser.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-bottom: 12px">Built with PAX-CORE</h4>
  <p>
    PAX components are built using <a class="mdw-secondary" href="http://webformula.io" target="_new">PAX-core</a>.
    This means the components are easy to develop and the end product requires no dependencies. So no broken npm sub
    modules.
